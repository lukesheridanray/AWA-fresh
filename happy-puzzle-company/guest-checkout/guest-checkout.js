"revenue per user
reached sales confirmation page
emails captured"

I have essentially created a guest checkout:
1) I have changed the wording and the title on the signin page.
2) I have removed the title, mobile and password fields from the address page.
3) I have added in wording on the details page about the money back guarantee, to offset worries about quality.
4) I have added an opportunity to ""Save your details"" on the post purchase screen.
