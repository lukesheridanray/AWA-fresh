This is not just a set of puzzles, it's real-life science! Absolutely awesome. Batteries included.</p>", "how_to_play":"<p>Work your way through the 60 challenges one by one - they get progressively harder. Each numbered card tells you how to arrange the board and which pieces may be used in that challenge. Your job is then to use the specified pieces to find a way to direct the laser to its target.</p><p>There are mirrors, beam-splitters, blockers and more, making this an ingenious activity that will help to develop skills in logic and strategy.</p>"}
