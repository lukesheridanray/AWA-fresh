I have given the use full access to the bucket gs://tbpawa

See how you get on, if you are uploading many files/folders then best to use the gsutil utility  with perhaps –m

Something like

gsutil -h "Cache-Control:public,max-age=259200" cp -m -a public-read -R /images/* gs://tbpawa/

There are two types:
Collections e.g. http://www.thebookpeople.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/qs_product_tbp?productId=484168&storeId=10001&catalogId=10051&langId=100

"Thumbnails will be added below the main product image, for inside pages. Clicking on the thumbnails will bring up a ""look inside"" overlay for that tumbnail (very similar to Amazon). The Look inside overlay will allow users to view each thumbnail and also feature an add to basket.

On collections the add to basket will also include a Price-per-book figure. The number of books is always at the end of the product title and the price is always above the add to basket. We will need to calculate the price per book from these two figures (always rounding up to the nearest penny)

Furthermore for collections the list of books contained with the main product copy in the centre of the pages, will include links that open up the same look inside overlay.

There will only be 1 or two pages per book, however as collections can contain up to 50 books, this can can still be a lot of pages. Ideally we don;t want to have to manually add each page, so it would be great if there was a way of simplifying this e.g. Could we save the pages within a specific folder structure and from that structure generate the look inside feature for the relevant pages? That's just an example - I'm very open to your suggestions of how we could make this workable, especially as we may repeat the test with even more books and pages."
