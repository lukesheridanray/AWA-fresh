At the turn of the 19th century Harold Peto, architect and garden designer, found a small and completely pendulous pale shell pink flowering cherry on one of his plant collecting trips to the East. He named it the Iford Cherry and it was planted on the Iford terraces and trailed down the terrace banks and along the paths creating a truly magnificent sight by all accounts of the time. In 1999 the present owners of Iford Manor decided to propagate from the only surviving tree which by then had only one living branch which was no thicker than a pencil. Graft wood was taken and the tree died a few weeks later. Three trees were raised from the grafts and became the mother wood for the trees now for sale.   This delightful and historic tree is ideal for growing in a container or as a small tree in the garden. It flowers in early spring and has a marvellous bronze/red leaf colour during the Autumn.

Incredible innovation in vegetable growing  All natural - no GM   Cordon.  Here's another major horticultural breakthrough from Thompson & Morgan! Specially hand-grafted plants producing potatoes AND tomatoes are now available to UK home gardeners for the first time. Above the ground harvest harvest over 500 cherry tomatoes with a Brix level of 10.2 - that's sweeter than supermarket tomatoes. Fruits also have just the right level of acidity that only the tastiest tomatoes have.   BUT THAT'S NOT ALL... Below the ground harvest heavy yields of up to 2kg of delicious white potatoes which are incredibly versatile. You can boil them, mash them, roast them or make chips. That's right! From one plant you can harvest tomatoes AND potatoes. This concept has been worked on for over 15 years, but this is the first time that plants have been successfully produced commercially. Tomatoes are members of the potato family and are therefore naturally compatible with potatoes. Each TomTato&reg; plant is specially grafted by hand to create this unique double cropping feature. There's no genetic modification - it's an all-natural, and safe process.   Plants come with growing and aftercare instructions. (Not that you'll really need them - these plants are so easy to grow!) Grow them indoors or outdoors, in a patio pot, on your allotment or on the vegetable patch.   View the TomTato&reg; video.
